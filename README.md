# AI_Agent_Project

The AI Agent Dashboard is a versatile tool designed to extract information from datasets based on custom queries. Users can upload a dataset either as a CSV file or connect to a Google Sheet, with the app providing a preview of the first three rows for better understanding. It allows users to select a specific column containing entities to process and supports seamless Google Sheets integration using `gspread` and service account credentials. With user-defined query templates, the app performs web searches for each entity using SerpApi and displays results, including URLs and snippets. Robust error handling ensures smooth operation, making it a strong foundation for advanced data extraction and analysis tasks.
